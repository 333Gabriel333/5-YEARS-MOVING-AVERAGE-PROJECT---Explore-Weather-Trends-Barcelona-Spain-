# 5-YEARS-MOVING-AVERAGE-PROJECT---Explore-Weather-Trends-Barcelona-Spain-
5 YEARS MOVING AVERAGE PROJECT - Explore Weather Trends (Barcelona, Spain)

PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS

Our goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, we’ll follow the steps below:

We extract the data from the database previously. We can find a list of cities and countries in the city_list table and another information in global_data table.

We open up the CSV using Jupyter Notebook with Python. We can find a list of cities and countries in the city_list table and another information in global_data table.

We create a line chart that compares our city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. We make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).

We make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions:

- Is our city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
- "How do the changes in our city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
- What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
